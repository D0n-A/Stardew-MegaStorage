# Stardew-MegaStorage

Adds Large Chests and Magic Chests to Stardew Valley.

# Large Chest
Capacity: 72 items (6 rows).

Recipe:
* 100 Wood
* 1 Copper Bar
* 1 Iron Bar
 
# Magic Chest
Infinite scrollable capacity.

Recipe:
* 200 Wood
* 10 Solar Essense
* 10 Void Essense

# Compatibility
Requires SMAPI.

Supports multiplayers and controllers.

Chests Anywhere: compatible, but viewing Large Chest and Magic Chest through Chests Anywhere will show only 3 rows.

# Is this safe?
Before saving, all Large Chests and Magic Chests are converted to normal chests. After saving, they are converted back. This makes sure your items aren't lost, even if uninstalling this mod. Believe it or not, normal chests have infinite capacity, it's only when adding items one at a time they are limited to 36 capacity.
