# Stardew-MegaStorage

Adds Large Chests and Magic Chests to Stardew Valley.

# Large Chest
Capacity: 72 items (6 rows).

Recipe:
* 100 Wood
* 1 Copper Bar
* 1 Iron Bar
 
# Magic Chest
Infinite scrollable capacity. Might add filters/categories and searching in the future.

Recipe:
* 200 Wood
* 10 Solar Essense
* 10 Void Essense

# Compatibility
* Requires SMAPI.
* Supports multiplayers and controllers.
* Harmony is not used.
* Chests Anywhere: compatible, but opening Large Chest and Magic Chest through Chests Anywhere will show them as normal chests.

# Is this safe?
Before saving, all Large Chests and Magic Chests are converted to normal chests. After saving, they are converted back. This makes sure your items aren't lost, even if uninstalling this mod. Believe it or not, normal chests have infinite capacity, it's only when adding items one at a time they are limited to 36 capacity.
